Assignments are not the most enjoyable thing to do, especially when it's 
some mindless arbitrary task.

Let's use some bash scripting to make our life easier

## The task ahead

It's OS class, the teacher gives you an assignment even tho it's 
the first day of the semester, not a fun start.

Looking in google classroom I see this,

`First experiment of OS Lab cycle (Refer syllabus) is Basic Linux commands.`

We're supposed to type in basic commands and take 
screenshots of the output and then compile them into a report with each command
having a title, description, example usage and screenshot.

## xdotool

xdotool is the holy grail of automating stuff,
it has pretty much anything someone would want to

```shell
[rosh@localhost ~]$ xdotool
Usage: xdotool <cmd> <args>
Available commands:
  getactivewindow
  getwindowfocus
  getwindowname
  getwindowpid
  getwindowgeometry
  getdisplaygeometry
  search
  selectwindow
  help
  version
  behave
  behave_screen_edge
  click
  getmouselocation
  key
  keydown
  keyup
  mousedown
  mousemove
  mousemove_relative
  mouseup
  set_window
  type
  windowactivate
  windowfocus
  windowkill
  windowmap
  windowminimize
  windowmove
  windowraise
  windowreparent
  windowsize
  windowunmap
  set_num_desktops
  get_num_desktops
  set_desktop
  get_desktop
  set_desktop_for_window
  get_desktop_for_window
  get_desktop_viewport
  set_desktop_viewport
  exec
  sleep

```
This is the final script that I came up with, automation is kinda neat huh :wink:

```bash
#!/bin/env bash

SLEEP_TIME=2
count=0

take_ss(){
    sleep $SLEEP_TIME
    if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
        ((count++))
        maim -i $(xdotool getactivewindow) "$2/$count.jpg"
        echo "taking screenshot..."
        xdotool key ctrl+l
    else
        xdotool type "$1"
        xdotool key KP_Enter
        sleep $SLEEP_TIME
    fi;
}

dir_resolution(){
    if [ -d "$1" ];then
        echo -n "do you want to overwrite the directory $2[y/N] : " 
        read n 
        if [ "$n" == "y" ];then
            rm -r "$1"
            mkdir "$1"
        else 
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        mkdir -p "$1"
    fi

}

main(){

    dir_resolution "$2"

    alacritty -e 'exec bash'
    while read -r line; do 
        echo "$line"
        take_ss "$line" "$2"
    done < "$1" 

    xdotool type "# press enter to kill this window"
    xdotool key KP_Enter
    xdotool type exit
    #xdotool windowkill $(xdotool getactivewindow)
}

[ $# -eq 0 ] && usage && exit
[ $# -eq 1 ] && usage && exit
[ $# -eq 2 ] && main "$@" && exit
[ $# -eq 3 ] && SLEEP_TIME="$3" && main "$@" && exit

```
